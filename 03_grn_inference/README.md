# Implementation of the different methods for GRN inference.

The scripts provided are:

- `genie3.R`: Functions to infer gene regulatory networks with GENIE3 with or without refinement via chromatin accessibility data.
- `l0l2.R`: Functions to infer gene regulatory networks with L0L2 regression with or without refinement via chromatin accessibility data.
- `mutual_info.R`: Functions to infer gene regulatory networks with Mutual Information with (i.e. MICA) or without refinement via chromatin accessibility data.
- `spearman.R`: Functions to infer gene regulatory networks with Spearman correlation with or without refinement via chromatin accessibility data.
- `rnd_predictor.R`: Functions to produce a random gene regulatory networks with or without refinement via chromatin accessibility data.
