# Scripts for nuclei segmentation

This folder contains ImageJ scripts and the CellProfiler pipepline for nuclei segmentation.

`1_LIF_series_expoter.ijm` and `2_batch_stardist.ijm` were kindly contributed by Dr Claire Simon at the Francis Crick Institute.
`3_split_files.ijm` and `5_CellProfiler_pipeline.cppipe` were modified by Dr Claire Simon from Dr Todd Fallesenâ€™s work (https://github.com/todd-fallesen/Niakan_Lab_KLF17) that was originally published in Lea et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.199378).
